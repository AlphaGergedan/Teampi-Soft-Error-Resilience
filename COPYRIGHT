According to good scientific practice, publications on results achieved in 
whole or in part due to teaMPI should cite at least one paper presenting the 
software. 

The owner wishes to make the software available to all users to use, reproduce,
modify, distribute and redistribute also for commercial purposes under the
following conditions of the original BSD license. Linking teaMPI 
statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
teaMPI. Thus, the terms and conditions of this license cover the whole
combination. Yet, the copyright holders explicitly give you permission to
link teaMPI with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of 
the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the 
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, 
for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of this license 
of that module.
